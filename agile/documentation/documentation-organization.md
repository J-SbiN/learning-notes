following, some notes to clarify some questions I could see asked: 

**Modus Operandi** gathers all the teams working methodologies and conventions. ex.: versioning stratrgy, branching strategy, naming conventions, ...

**Services** is for the developers. Should contain requirements, how to run a local/debug/test/integration mode, very technical information, keep track of corner cases, worarrounds.

**User Readables** contains an HowTo/FAQ section whitch is a list of links to the services bellow it. Each service should contain a very user-oriented description of the services, how to use them and how to do some basic troubleshooting and reporting. Links the rest of the documentation may be usefull.

**Archive**  is exactly what the name suggests. Files that are not oftemly used or no longer up to date but need to be kept for auditing, history, future reference...  ex.: the documentation of an older version of one of the services or the golas&reports or  outcomes of retros of the past year.
When you move a page here, you should replicate the folder structure to keep visibility of what was mooved.
