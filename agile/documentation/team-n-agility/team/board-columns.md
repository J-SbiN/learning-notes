# Our Needs
(discuss with team to get something like:)
- some cards already have tasks to enter the next sprint but are not fully planned 
- some times our work relays on a third party dependence
- we want our changes to be tested:
    - on the unit test level
    - on the integration level
    - on the functional level
    - on the UI/UX level
    - by the costumer
