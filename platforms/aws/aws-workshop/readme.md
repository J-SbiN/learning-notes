## Description:
This is a workshop was prepared to provide support to a quick start on cloud services.
On the "`Introduction`" round, the main concepts aim to be as agnostic as possible.
For the "`Hands-On Sessions`" we will focus on specific tool-set choices. For these choices we will try to discuss the major pros-&-cons for the most common scenarios while keeping the best practices, and proceed with the ones we find to be the best fit to make specific features/shortages evident.

To consume this workshop you should first read the "`Introduction`" and then follow with the "`Theoretical Presentations`" and "`Hands-On Sessions`" for each of the topics brushed on the "`Theoretical Introduction`"
