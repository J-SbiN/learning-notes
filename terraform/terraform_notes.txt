# Terraform



## Terraform Execution:
	everything is configured as code
	keeps track of versioning of the infrastructure code
	automatically decides when to parallelize/sequentialize tasks
	

## Terraform Configuration:
	

## 4 Main Commands:
	Refresh - 	check what the world looks like
	Plan	-	create an action plan to change the infrastructure to what is described
	Apply	-	applies the 'Plan'
	Destroy	-	destroys all elements in a systematic fashion
	

## Terraform Architecture:
	TF Configuration [user input]
	TF (monolithic) Core
	TF Status [the result of refresh - managed by TF]
	Providers [any external services I/P/SaaS]
